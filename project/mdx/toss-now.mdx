### Introduction  

One day one of my friend asked me to make somthing to toss Heands or Tail. Because when he went to play cricket with his friends, they always struggle to find a coin to toss. So I made this app for him.

In this app I used real world physics to make the coin toss more realistic. I used Unity&prime;s inbuilt physics engine to make this app. When the user swipe up on screen the coin will be tossed and when it falls down on the ground it will show the result.




### Demo  

Here is some screenshots and a short wolk through of the app:

First of all, one of the player needs to choose a sied of coin. After chooseing Heads or Tail it will shown on the top of teh screen. And this is a require task to go ahade for toss. Because if you if you don′t make a choice first you will not abale to make toss.

Now time to through the coin for toss. In order to throug the coin up player needs to swipe up he screen. The coin will go more higher if the the player swipe a long way, if the swipe is short the coin will go less higher

When the coin falls down on the ground it will show the result. If the result is same as the player′s choice then he will win the toss. Otherwise he will lose the toss. And a UI will be shown to the player to show the result.

If the player wants to toss again he can toss again by clicking the Toss Again button.
